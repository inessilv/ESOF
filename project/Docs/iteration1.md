## Iteration retrospective meeting
In this iteration, in order to better understand the approach of the UNI app developers, we started by analyzing the source code of the app so that we could implement a 
similar structure as we began to integrate our own code. As our first step, we added the "notifications" option to the sidebar of UNI, as this is the foundation of our 
project. In order to do this, we took a look at the way the developers had done it and found it to be quite straightfoward. The next part was creating the main page of
the notifications tab and, in order to replicate the mockups we had previously created, we couldn't rely on the app's code as much, because it didn't have many 
similarities. But, with some searching and effort, we managed to replicate what we had planned for this page perfectly. To finish, we created the main pages for each
of the categories and added specific notifications with togglable switches, which was our final goal for this iteration. In the end, we are pleased with the work we 
accomplished on this iteration and with the fact that we gained more experience for the upcoming ones. We believe we followed good practices and together with a good
team chemistry, things became easier. As it was our first iteration, we decided to program as a group so that we could try to understand the source code together as well
as implement the foundation of our feature to have a unanimous decision, but as a downside our efficiency decreased significantly,therefore on the next ones, we pretend 
to change this by starting to work as pairs, as well as have a greater pace at implementing new features.

## What went well?
We are very satisfied with the things we accomplished on this first iterations , since we managed to implement a big part of the 
interface in our feature and already integrated it on the UNI app which took us some time, since we spent some time understanding
the source code of the uni app, but after we had a reasonably good understanding of it, it helped us with some of the implementation used in our feature. Finally
we also think we made good use of the git flow and the project backlog.

## What should we do differently?
In the next iterations we intend to do a better estimate of what we will be able to complete, as well as increase our efficiency when implementing new features, 
as we gain more experience and become more familiarized with Flutter.  
In what comes to acceptance tests, we pretend to focus more on it as soon as we are done implementing the “major” user stories. 
However, we are very satisfied about what we were capable to develop as beginners and we feel more prepared for the ones to come.

## What still puzzles me?
When we started thinking about the unit test implementation some doubts came to our minds since the "path" from the UNI app to 
our feature was not done by us and we weren't quite sure how to test that "path". We haven't decided yet how we are going to implement the notifications and 
the monthly file since there's a lot of search to be done about flutter in order to find the best way of implementing these features.
