## Iteration retrospective meeting


## What went well?
- In this iteration, we were able to implement some new features and we also made significant progress in the main features of our app.            
- We added some tests for the features implemented in the last iteration, which was one of the challenges we faced.
- We started to develop following the correct gitflow.
- We adpoted Pair Programming as our software development technique.

## What should we do differently?
- In this iteration, we significantly improved our approach to the work we had ahead, in relation to the previous one, 
therefore, believing there isn't much room for improvement in said approach, regarding the next iteration.

## What still puzzles me?
- In relation to the first iteration, we faced an increasing number of problems due to the complexity of the features we pretended to implement. Although we managed to solve most of the issues, some doubts still remain, specifically related to data scraping and the database.
